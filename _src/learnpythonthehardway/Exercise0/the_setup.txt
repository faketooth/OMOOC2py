Learn Python the Hard way

This is a text file edited by TextWrangler.


If someone tells you to stop at a specific exercise in this book or to skip certain ones, you should ignore that person.
If a programmer tells you to use vim or emacs, just say "no". These editors are for when you are a better programmer. 
A programmer may try to get you to install Python 3 and learn that. Say, "When all of the Python code on your computer is Python 3, then I'll try to learn it."
